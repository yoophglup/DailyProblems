//Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two
//given nodes in the BST. The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes
//p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we
//allow a node to be a descendant of itself).[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor]


//                  6
//                /   \
//              2       8
//             / \     / \
//            0   4   7   9
//               / \
//              3   5

//Exaple 1:
//Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
//Output: 6
//Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

//Example 2:
//Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
//Output: 2
//Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of
//itself according to the LCA definition.
